**Paping-NG** – the modern successor to `paping`. Cross-platform TCP/UDP port ping tool rewritten from scratch in modern C++. Fast, lightweight, and open-source.

Replaces the unmaintained original [9minds/paping](https://github.com/9minds/paping) and legacy fixes like [arch3rek/Paping-fixed](https://github.com/arch3rek/Paping-fixed).

## Features

- **Familiar & Intuitive**: Works just like the original `paping` tool. The familiar command-line interface ensures zero learning curve for existing users.
- **Cross-platform**: Native support for Linux, macOS, Windows, and ARM architectures.
- **High Performance**: Rewritten from scratch in C++ for maximum efficiency.
- **Advanced Metrics**: Accurate RTT (min/avg/max), connection statistics, and timeouts.
- **Modern Networking**: Support for IPv4, IPv6, and standard TCP handshakes.
- **Drop-in Replacement**: Uses the exact same `paping` command name. You don't have to break your muscle memory or learn new tools – it simply works the way you expect.


## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries (Recommended)
Download the ready-to-use executables for Windows and Linux from the [Releases](https://github.com/arch3rek/Paping-NG/releases) page.

### Build from source
If you prefer to compile it yourself, you will need `CMake` and a modern C++ compiler (GCC/Clang/MSVC):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arch3rek/Paping-NG.git
cd Paping-NG
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Usage

Paping-NG is designed to be highly intuitive. It mimics the behavior and arguments of the original tool, allowing you to seamlessly integrate it into your existing workflow.

```bash
# Basic TCP ping
paping example.com -p 80

# Specify amount of packets (-c)
paping 8.8.8.8 -p 53 -c 5

# See all options
paping --help
```
